    <p>The Night before CX-MAS is an annual fundraising event put on by <a
            href="https://www.instagram.com/southernwonders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Southern Wonders</a> that
        takes place the <em>~night before cx-mas~</em>. This year, it will be a poker ride to benefit <a
            href="https://raleighcommunitykickstand.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Raleigh Community
            Kickstand</a>.</p>
    <p>What's a poker ride? It's more of a scavenger hunt than a race. Meet at Oak City Cycling at 5pm. At 5:30, you
        will be given a manifest with clues to 7 locations. You will chart a route from there to hit as many spots
        as you can before the 7pm deadline. At each stop, you will meet (and thank!) a volunteer and draw a card. Your
        goal will be to collect at least 5 cards for a full hand. At 7pm, we will play a single round of poker at Oak
        City Cycling. The person with the best hand wins!</p>
    <h2>Manifest</h2>
    <p>Use the clues below to guess the establishments. If you've guessed correctly, you'll get the checkpoint address
        and where to find the volunteer with the cards. The manifest will be unlocked at the start.</p>

    <h2>Poker Hands</h2>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Five of a Kind</strong>: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., 9, 9, 9, 9, 2).</li>
        <li><strong>Royal Flush</strong>: A, K, Q, J, 10, all of the same suit.</li>
        <li><strong>Straight Flush</strong>: Five consecutive cards of the same suit (e.g., 8, 9, 10, J, Q of hearts).
        </li>
        <li><strong>Four of a Kind</strong>: Four cards of the same rank (e.g., 9, 9, 9, 9, 2).</li>
        <li><strong>Full House</strong>: Three of a kind combined with a pair (e.g., 7, 7, 7, 4, 4).</li>
        <li><strong>Flush</strong>: Five cards of the same suit, not in sequence (e.g., 2, 5, 8, J, K of spades).</li>
        <li><strong>Straight</strong>: Five consecutive cards of different suits (e.g., 4, 5, 6, 7, 8).</li>
        <li><strong>Three of a Kind</strong>: Three cards of the same rank (e.g., Q, Q, Q, 5, 9).</li>
        <li><strong>Two Pair</strong>: Two different pairs (e.g., 10, 10, 4, 4, 6).</li>
        <li><strong>One Pair</strong>: Two cards of the same rank (e.g., A, A, 3, 8, J).</li>
        <li><strong>High Card</strong>: When no other hand is made, the highest card wins (e.g., Ace high).</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tiebreaker</h2>
    <p>If two or more players have the same winning type of hand, the player with the highest-ranking card in their hand
        wins. If those are tied, the next highest card (kicker) is compared, continuing until a winner is determined. If
        they are somehow completely tied, the winner will be whoever can guess the number of cable ends in a container.
