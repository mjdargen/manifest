        clue: "Long before craft beer became popular in Raleigh, this venue on Hillsborough Street was the city’s one and only brew shop. Though it didn’t brew beer, it provided a stage for many young, local bands to perform.",
        answer: "The Brewery",
        address: "3009 Hillsborough Street"
    },
    2: {
        clue: "This venue was the loudest club in town for a long time, and not because it exclusively booked heavy metal bands, but because the acoustics were just awful. Today, it serves coffee and still books metal and goth bands under its new boney moniker.",
        answer: "The Maywood",
        address: "658 Maywood Ave"
    },
    3: {
        clue: "This venue was the only industrial and goth club in Downtown Raleigh. Founded in 1985, it attracted black-clad freaks and geeks who lined up for industrial dance nights featuring the sounds of Depeche Mode, Front 242, and even early Nine Inch Nails. Today, the building is slated for demolition. Just don’t let the smell of hot wieners distract you when you arrive.",
        answer: "The Fallout Shelter",
        address: "2 S. West Street"
